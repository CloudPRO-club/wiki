## Project description
It is required to develop from scratch an autonomous, non-profit (subsidized) educational platform aimed at raising the level of awareness of people with certain technologies in the field of software development. Using game forms of learning.

The authors prepare educational material, which is packaged in the "life story" presentation format and published on the platform, after which it becomes available for independent study by an interested person.

The student "lives" (independently selected for study) educational material (theory and practice) prepared in the form of a "life story"; upon successful completion of the assignments, he receives an award.


## The value of the platform for the consumer
The learning process (familiarization) with the selected technology playfully takes place, which helps the person studying the material to become more involved in the learning process
